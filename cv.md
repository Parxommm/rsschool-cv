## About me:
I am an active and purposeful person.
After graduating from university, I worked at a factory as a simple worker and in a short time I became a manager with a good salary. But this job became boring to me and I began to look for self-development in another area.
I am constantly striving to develop my skills, am not afraid of difficult tasks and learn new technologies, so I came to this course.

## Code example:
### **Count cats!**
*Your task is to count the cats hidden in the backyard (presented by two-dimensional Array). Cats hide well, but their ears ("^^") are clearly visible. Your task is to implement the countCats(backyard) function that will count cats. Good luck!*
*Number of cats found should be number. If no cats found, function should return 0.*

*For example:*
```countCats([ [0, 1, '^^'], [0, '^^', 2], ['^^', 1, 2] ]) => 3```
```
  const countCats = (arr) => {
  let cats = [];
  arr.forEach(box => {
    cats.push(...box.filter(el => el === '^^'));
  })
  return cats.length;
}
```
