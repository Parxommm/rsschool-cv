## About me:
I am an active and purposeful person.
After graduating from university, I worked at a factory as a simple worker and in a short time I became a manager with a good salary. But this job became boring to me and I began to look for self-development in another area.
I am constantly striving to develop my skills, am not afraid of difficult tasks and learn new technologies, so I came to this course.
